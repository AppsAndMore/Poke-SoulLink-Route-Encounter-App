Poke SoulLink Route Encounter: Privacy policy

 I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either. All pokemon sprites belong to the Pokemon Company. The app uses the open source PokeApi to fetch the pokemon names, sprites and their pokedex numbers. The app is simply intended to aid pokemon players when they play any pokemon game with their friends as a "SoulLink Nuzlocke". Keeping tracks of the routes and pokemon they caught in each route.


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
